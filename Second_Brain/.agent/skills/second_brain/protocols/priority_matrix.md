# Priority Matrix Protocol

> How to help prioritize when feeling overwhelmed.

## The Eisenhower Matrix

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | DO FIRST | SCHEDULE |
| **Not Important** | DELEGATE | ELIMINATE |

## When User Seems Scattered

1. Ask: "What are the top 3 things on your mind?"
2. Apply the priority matrix
3. Remind them of their #1 goal from `context/goals.md`
4. Suggest focusing on ONE thing

## Response Template

```
## Your Current Chaos:
[List what they mentioned]

## Suggested Priorities:
1. 🔴 DO NOW: [Most urgent + important]
2. 🟡 SCHEDULE: [Important but not urgent]
3. 🟢 CONSIDER LATER: [Everything else]

## Remember:
Your #1 priority is: [from goals.md]
Focus there first.
```
