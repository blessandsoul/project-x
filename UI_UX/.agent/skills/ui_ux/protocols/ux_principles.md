# UX Principles Protocol

## Core Principles

### 1. User-Centered Design
The user's needs come first, always.
- Understand before designing
- Test with real users
- Iterate based on feedback

### 2. Clarity Over Cleverness
Users should never have to think about how to use something.
- Obvious is better than clever
- Familiar patterns over novel solutions
- Self-explanatory interfaces

### 3. Reduce Cognitive Load
Minimize mental effort required.
- One primary action per screen
- Progressive disclosure
- Consistent patterns

### 4. Provide Feedback
Users should always know what's happening.
- Loading states
- Success confirmations
- Clear error messages
- Progress indicators

### 5. Prevent Errors
Design to prevent mistakes.
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Undo where possible
- Clear labels and instructions
- Sensible defaults

### 6. Flexibility
Support different users and use cases.
- Keyboard navigation
- Multiple ways to complete tasks
- Customization options
