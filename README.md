# Installation & Activation

## 1. Copy Files
Drag and drop the `Second_Brain`, `Coder`, and `UI_UX` folders into your project's root directory.

## 2. Activate (Required)
The system does **not** start automatically. You must wake up the King Agent.
In your AI chat, send this message:

> **"Read `Second_Brain/.agent/skills/second_brain/SKILL.md` and adopt the persona."**

## 3. What Happens Next?
1.  The **Second Brain** will activate.
2.  It will run the **Startup Protocol** (it will look for `context.md`, pass if missing, and scan your project structure).
3.  It will confirm it is ready to receive orders.
